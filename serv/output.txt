Foreshadowing in Of Mice and Men Alludes to the Tragic Ending


In Steinbeck’s novella, Of Mice and Men, almost every character and setting is used for foreshadowing. The story is intertwined with many disputes, igniting other feuds once one is sparked. With the advancement of the plot, the underlying message behind the character’s choice of words and actions conveys the themes of loneliness and the American dream; which together ultimately allude to the tragic ending. 

Loneliness, a major theme in the novella is introduced right at the beginning, where the story takes place “a few miles south of Soledad,”(p.1) directly translating to a few miles off of solitaire or loneliness. This sets off the tone of the story, contrasting the distinct relationship between George and Lennie. George has a great sense of responsibility for Lennie, due to Aunt Clara’s words and Lennie is dependent on George, making them more connected than most men during the great depression. However, a sense of loneliness prevails the connections between the men in the story. George and Lennie’s relationship is one-sided, where Lennie can not give George any shape of mental support, making them simultaneously connected and lonely. The true definition of friendship can not illustrate their relationship, foreshadowing the dilemmas which they will run into such as George’s helplessness when Lennie kills Curley’s wife. In addition, Curley’s wife is viewed as Curley’s possession, but the fragmented presence of the couple shows that they have a toxic relationship; which leads to Curley’s wife’s urge to speak with Lennie. From the ultimate consequence of Lennie and Curley’s wife’s ‘conversation,’ it is evident that Curley’s behaviour and the ‘cracks’ in their relationship contribute to the death of his wife. Therefore, loneliness is an underlying theme throughout, as demonstrated by George and Lennie’s one-sided relationship and Curley’s wife’s position as her husband’s possession; foreshadowing the deaths of the characters. 

Furthermore, the progressing inadvertent death of animals at the hands of Lennie implies the death of Curley’s wife. In the first scene of the story, the consequence of Lennie’s unhealthy love for soft things begins to appear. Although he claims that he “wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with [the mouse]...jus’ strokin’ it”(p.9), the mouse is killed by Lennie’s rough hands. His mental incapacity makes him a dangerous character in the narrative, where by natural instinct, I knew that the power of this man cannot be underestimated in the latter part of the plot. As the story progresses, George also reveals the reason for fleeing Weed, where Lennie grabs onto the dress of a girl, which convinces the reader of Lennie’s actions when he is around girls. Later in the story, Lennie accidentally ‘murders’ the puppy, in which he continues to say “[he] didn’t bounce [the pup] hard…[he] di’n’t know [the pup would] get killed so easy.” (p. 85) All of these instances confirm the impression of Lennie’s excessive obsession with soft things, where more trouble awaits the people on the ranch. Thus, when Curley’s wife asks Lennie to touch her hair, his inability to control his hands for soft things foreshadows the death of Curley’s wife. 

Moreover, through Crooks and Lennie’s conversation, the realist Crooks tries to persuade the ultimate optimist Lennie, that George and Lennie’s American dream of getting ‘a little place’ is impossible. Crook’s blunt comments on how “[Lennie is] nuts...nobody ever gets to heaven, and nobody gets no land…[and Lennie and Candy are] just kiddin’ [themselves],” (p. 75) align with my realistic views on their imaginary land. Although some may argue that having a dream pushes one to work harder and have a goal to strive for, it is crucial that we differentiate between ambitions and dreams. In the novella, George and Lennie’s plans seem impractical, since the amount of money they saved is far from what they need. Although Candy also declares his participation in their mission, their plan did not seem feasible to Crooks, since he has “seen too many guys [with] land in his head…[he has] never seen a guy really do it” (p.76) Sequentially, George and Lennie are unable to get their own land, like all of the other men due to the many problems which arise because of Lennie’s idiocy. Ultimately, the failure of George and Lennie’s plan is no surprise, as predicted by Crooks.

Ultimately, Curley’s wife’s loneliness motivates her to have the conversation with Lennie, in which his inability to control his hands causes her own death. Lennie’s death which precedes the death of the wife ends George’s hope for their dream of getting ‘a little place.’ This chain reaction of events leads to the heartbreaking end of Lennie and George’s relationship and their American dream. Therefore, the continuous foreshadowing of the characters and their actions allows the reader to almost anticipate the presuming surprise ending of the tragic deaths.
